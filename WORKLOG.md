# FocusPoint — Working Log

A personal AI agent with memory. Built with Vercel Eve + Next.js + Neon Postgres.

---

## Session: 2026-06-28

### 12:25 — Project kick-off

**Goal:** Build a personal AI agent that captures thoughts, builds memory about the user, and helps with calendar reminders + todos.

**Decisions made:**
- Framework: Vercel Eve (launched June 17 2026 — "Next.js for agents")
- Frontend: Next.js 15, App Router
- Storage: Neon Postgres (via Vercel Marketplace) — thoughts, todos, memories
- Integrations: Google Calendar (day one), email (later)
- Todo list: built-in (no external app)
- Memory: cloud is fine, stored in our own Neon DB

**Two surfaces:**
- Mobile web: quick capture bar, recent thoughts, chat
- Desktop web: full dashboard (notes/todos/calendar left) + agent chat (right)

---

### 12:30 — Scaffolding started

- Ran `npx eve init focuspoint-agent` — created Eve agent project
- Ran `eve channels add web` — scaffolded Next.js web chat UI
- Installed `@neondatabase/serverless` for Postgres

### Next steps (to get it running)

1. **Set up Neon Postgres**
   - Go to vercel.com/marketplace → add Neon Postgres integration
   - Pull env: `cd focuspoint-agent && vercel link && vercel env pull`
   - Run schema migration (the `ensureSchema()` fn creates tables on first API call)

2. **Link to Vercel**
   - `cd focuspoint-agent && vercel link`

3. **Run locally**
   - `cd focuspoint-agent && npm run dev`
   - Eve dev server + Next.js at localhost:3000

4. **Google Calendar (optional, for now)**
   - Add `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ACCESS_TOKEN` to Vercel env vars
   - Agent gracefully skips calendar if token is absent

5. **Deploy**
   - `vercel deploy --prod`

### 13:30 — Database Explorer added ✓

**New route:** `/explore`

- Stats bar: total memories, active todos, completed today
- Memories tab: full searchable list of all captured thoughts, with tags + timestamps, delete on hover
- Todos tab: all todos including completed, filterable by status + search, priority badges
- Nav icon (database icon) in the chat header links to `/explore`
- Back arrow on explore page returns to `/`
- New API routes: `GET /api/stats`, `DELETE /api/thoughts/[id]`, `DELETE /api/todos/[id]`
- Updated `GET /api/thoughts` and `GET /api/todos` to accept `limit` and `include_completed` query params

**Also done this session:**
- Moved `focuspoint-agent` up to be the root `focuspoint` directory (removed nesting)
- Connected GitHub repo: `bertovmill/focuspoint`
- Connected Vercel project to `bertmill19s-projects` account (has AI Gateway credits)
- Provisioned Neon Postgres under correct account
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` to require agents to read `WORKLOG.md` before starting work
